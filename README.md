## What is 'Lemonade for iOS'?
Lemonade for iOS is a project of building an application I originally had developed for Android using Android Studio and Kotlin, from the ground up using XCode and Swift.

I originally built Lemonade as part of my BSc Computer Science degree. 
<br><br>One of my modules in second year was Agile Development. 
<br>This module taught me how to develop applications using Agile methodology via developing an Android application as part of a team.
<br><br>Technology stacks utilised for the group project were:
1) Android Studio
2) Kotlin
3) Google Firebase
4) Pivitoal Tracker

To consolidate everything I had learned before commencing on the group work, I decided to build a simple and fun application for my son. Thus, Lemonade was born!

## What does the app do?
Lemonade is a simple application, where the user is presented with a background image of a farmyard and a single, lone lemon tree. The user is instructed to pick a lemon from the tree in order to squash the lemon and make... LEMONADE!
<br><br>Once a lemon is picked from the tree, a lemon is shown to the user and instructed to tap the lemon to make lemonade. 
<br>The amount of taps it takes to squash the lemon is random each time. 
<br><br>Once this is completed, a glass full of lemonade is shown to the user and the user is prompted to tap the glass to drink it.
<br>*Mmm yumm, how refreshing!*

<br>After the glass of lemonade is drank, an empty glass is displayed to the user and they are prompted to tap the empty glass to start again!
<br><br>A count of how many lemons have been squashed during the current app session is displayed to the user at the top of the screen during the lemon-squashing section.
