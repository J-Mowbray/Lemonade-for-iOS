## What is 'Lemonade for iOS'?

Lemonade for iOS is a project of building an application I originally had developed for Android using Android Studio and Kotlin, from the ground up using XCode and Swift.
<br><br>Built for iOS 17 and above in XCode version 16.0. 

<br>
I originally built Lemonade as part of my BSc Computer Science degree. 
<br><br>One of my modules in second year was Agile Development. 
<br>This module taught me how to develop applications using Agile methodology via developing an Android application as part of a team.
<br><br>Technology stacks utilised for the group project were:
1) Android Studio
2) Kotlin
3) Google Firebase
4) Pivitoal Tracker

To consolidate everything I had learned before commencing on the group work, I decided to build a simple and fun application for my son. Thus, Lemonade was born!
<br><br> I took the basis of this from the Android Basics in Kotlin course from Google, which can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course), and scaled it up from there to have a different background etc.

## What does the app do?
Lemonade is a simple application, where the user is presented with a background image of a farmyard and a single, lone lemon tree. The user is instructed to pick a lemon from the tree in order to squash the lemon and make... *LEMONADE!*
<br><br>Once a lemon is picked from the tree, a lemon is shown to the user and instructed to tap the lemon to make lemonade. 
<br>The amount of taps it takes to squash the lemon is random each time. 
<br><br>Once this is completed, a glass full of lemonade is shown to the user and the user is prompted to tap the glass to drink it.
<br>*Mmm yumm, how refreshing!*

<br>After the glass of lemonade is drank, an empty glass is displayed to the user and they are prompted to tap the empty glass to start again!
<br><br>A count of how many lemons have been squashed during the current app session is displayed to the user at the top of the screen during the lemon-squashing section.

## Devices Tested on and confirm working:

This section will be updated if/when it is tested on further devices. 
<br>Please see below for the devices it has been tested on thus far and confirmed to be working as intended:
- [x] iPad 6th Generation running iPadOS 17.7
- [x] iPhone 16 Pro running iOS 18.1

## New Features added! *More to also come in time...*

Whilst this is still a simple application, a lot of time has been made to make improvements to the application and add features to it, with ideas in the pipline to further expand it!
<br><br>

*What's New?*
-------------

Originally, the app was quite bland and only had the interactive elements of being able to tap the images to make the lemonade and the counter at the top, stating how many lemons have been squashed. 
<br><br>Now however, I've added some copyright free music to the application to make it a much nicer experience!
<br> All credit for the music goes to [Chillpeach](https://www.youtube.com/@Chillpeach). Please check out their work and support them.
<br><br> The music in the application is called ['On The Top' and can be listened to here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwiHerRkCvk)

<br><br>
A detailed list of features I wish to implement will be added here, hopefully Soonâ„¢.
